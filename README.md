An e-commerce website built using Django and Python allows businesses to sell products online, manage inventory, handle transactions, and provide a seamless shopping experience. Django, a high-level Python framework, offers a powerful admin interface, secure user authentication, and robust scalability. Key features typically include:

1. **Product Management**: Create, update, and display products with images, descriptions, and pricing.
2. **User Accounts**: Allow customers to register, log in, and manage their profiles.
3. **Shopping Cart**: Enable users to add and remove products before checking out.
4. **Order Management**: Handle order processing, payments, and shipping.
5. **Payment Integration**: Integrate payment gateways like Stripe or PayPal for secure transactions.
6. **Search and Filtering**: Implement product search and filtering options for easy navigation.
7. **Admin Dashboard**: Use Django's admin panel to manage orders, products, and customer data.

Djangoâ€™s modularity and scalability make it ideal for creating customizable and efficient e-commerce platforms.
